## Project Title

ResNet Like CNN for Image Processing with CIFAR10 Dataset

## Description

This project implements a ResNet-like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image processing using the CIFAR10 dataset. It compares the effects of Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization, and Group Normalization in image processing tasks.

## Installation

-   Install required libraries by running: `pip install tensorflow_addons`
-   Ensure TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, and other necessary libraries are installed

## Dataset

The code uses the CIFAR10 dataset for training and testing the model.

## Model Architecture

-   The model architecture is based on a ResNet-like design with specific layers and normalization techniques.
-   It includes functions for defining the model, optimizer, loss function, and training the model.

## Training

-   The model is trained on the dataset with specified epochs and batch size.
-   Training progress, loss, and accuracy are visualized through plots.

## Evaluation

-   The model is evaluated on the test data to assess its performance.
-   Confusion matrices are generated to analyze the model's predictions.

## Usage

-   Users can utilize the provided functions to define custom ResNet-like models with different normalization techniques.
-   The code includes functions for saving trained models and plotting loss/accuracy diagrams.
